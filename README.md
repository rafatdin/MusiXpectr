>In accordance with University regulations, Final Year Project (both software and report) is the UoW property. The incomplete content of the project is provided to you for reference only.

### Build
Project is ready to build in Unity3D (tested on macOS el capitan) for iOS. In order to build for Android you'll have to download AndroidSDK and set the path in unity editor before building.
The algorithms for audio processing are already built and available in root *bass.dll* file.

### The game
The game itself is based on [Audiosurf](http://audiosurf2.com/). Gameplay is round-based, with each round built depending on the rhythm of the music. Player manages the spaceship, which flies on the "audio-trek" in the space, collects the "moods" and dodges the spikes. The moods adds the point and spikes deduct them. The task is to collect as much points as possible the music/round ends.

The audio for round is selected from music library on the phone by the user manually.

#### Improvement
The game is solely developed by me as a final year project, so it is far far away from perfect (its not even very nice) but it is good as a boilerplate (especially for designers). So feel free to fork it, improve it, sell it (with proper references) and request pulls for common good :)
